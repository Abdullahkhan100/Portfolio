          Hello, Iâ€™m Abdullah Khan, a dedicated and passionate Web Developer and
          UI Designer with 3.8 years of experience in building visually
          appealing and user-centric websites. My expertise lies in creating
          clean, responsive, and functional designs using technologies like
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS.

          to bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics to deliver an
          exceptional user experience.
